====== CryptoSMS Presentation ======

===== Introduction =====

==== Aims ====
* Protect the transmission
* Protect the stored data

==== Reasons ====

==== Facts ====
* Assumes presence of a service providing means of signing data and verifying signatures (Public Keys)
* Symmetric encryption AES-256/CBC/HMAC-SHA-256 for both messages and storage file
* Cryptographic keys are negotiated using Elliptic Curve Deffie-Hellman protocol

===== Demo =====
* Start with two phones, one being Alice and the other Bob, both already running CryptoSMS
* Say that the public keys have already been exchanged
* Explain the meaning of each tab on the main screen
* Do a handshake (key negotiation)
	* Alice
		* Opens the //Contacts// tab, clicks on //New contact//
		* (Explain that currently it only supports key negotiation over text messages, but could support other ways in the future)
		* Selects //Text message//, clicks on //Next//
		* Confirms sending by clicking //Send//
		* (Explain that it's waiting for reply from Bob)
	* Bob
		* Waits for the handshake request to appear 
		* Clicks on it, selects //Accept and confirm//
		* (Explain that Bob has everything to generate the keys and therefore it says Encryption active on the Contacts tab)
	* Alice
		* Receives the reply and status changes to //Encryption active// as well
* Send some messages
	* Alice
		* Clicks on Bob's entry in the //Contacts// list, which opens the //Conversation// screen
		* Types in "Hey Bob!" and clicks on //Send//
		* The message appears in the list
	* ''Bob''
		* New conversation appears in the //Conversations// tab
		* Clicks on the conversation entry
		* Types in "Hello Alice" and hits //Send//
	* Alice
		* Message from Bob appears on her screen

===== Attacker =====
* Has access to everything you send (carrier)
	* Can act as a middle-man and change the sent data
* Can install a malicious application on your phone
* Has physical access to your handset (thief)

===== SMS format =====

==== Data SMS ====
* Special format of text messages that helps with distinguishing it from the rest
* Advantages
	* Not touched or saved by the system (gives us full control)
	* Sent to a specific port (same as TCP/IP - different applications can listen to messages on different ports)
* Disadvantages
	* Only 133 bytes instead of 140
* Therefore, we are very limited in terms of space

==== Multi-part messages ====
* Multi-part messages are standardized for normal texts, but not for Data SMS
* We need to recognize, which individual messages belong together and form a multi-part message
	* First three bytes are used for a header
		* Type (text / handshake) - 2 bits
		* ID - 14 bits
			* same for all parts
			* random (1:16000 chance of messing everything up)
		* Number of parts / part's index
			* different for each message part
			* up to 256 parts ~ 30 KB of data in a single message
	* Leaves us with 130 bytes per text message for the actual data
	* Text messages are said to belong together if they:
		* Come from the same phone number, and
		* Have the same type and ID
	* None of these are verified and therefore can be tempered with by middle-man
* The actual transmitted data is cut into chunks of 130 bytes and divided between parts

==== Storing text ====
* Both ASCII and Unicode
* Compression with DEFLATE (ZIP)
* Always chooses the best possibility (especially good for European languages)
* One byte header
